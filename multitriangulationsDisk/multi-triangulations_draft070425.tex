\section{Introduction}\label{sectionintroduction}

A \emph{$k$-triangulation of a convex $n$-gon} is a maximal set of edges such that no $k+1$ of them mutually cross. Several properties of triangulations have already been generalized to $k$-triangulations, and particularly: 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item all $k$-triangulations of a convex $n$-gon have the same number of edges \cite{cp-tttccp-92,n-gdfcp-00,dkm-lahp-02};
\item any $k$-triangulation has at least $2k$ edges of length $k+1$ \cite{n-gdfcp-00};
\item any edge of length at least $k+1$ can be flipped and the graph of flips is regular and connected \cite{n-gdfcp-00,dkm-lahp-02};
\item any $k+1$ consecutive points of a $k$-triangulation of the $(n+1)$-gon can be merged into $k$ points, the incident edges being moved, to obtain a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon \cite{n-gdfcp-00,j-gt-03};
\item the set of $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon is enumerated by a Catalan determinant \cite{j-gt-03,j-gtdfssp-05}.
\end{enumerate}

Surprisingly, as far as we know, there was no direct proofs of (i), (ii) and (iii). Indeed, (i) was always proved assuming (iii) \cite{n-gdfcp-00,dkm-lahp-02}, (ii) was always proved assuming (i), and (iii) was always proved assuming (iv), that is recursively \cite{n-gdfcp-00,j-gt-03}. Furthermore, there was no basic geometric object in $k$-triangulations that correspond to triangles in triangulations. In this paper, we fill this gap.

If $p$ and $q$ are two coprime integers, a \emph{star polygon} of type $\{p/q\}$ is a polygon formed by connecting a set $V=\{s_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_p\}$ of $p$ points of the unit circle with the set $E=\{[s_{jq},s_{(j+1)q}] \;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_p\}$ of edges that divide the other points into two part of size $q-1$ and $p-q-1$ (see \cite[ pp. 93-95]{c-rp-73}, \cite[pp. 36-38]{c-ig-73} and fig. \ref{starpolygons}). Since they correspond to polygons when we allow crossings, it is natural to think that some star polygons may appear in $k$-triangulations. In fact, the natural generalization of the triangle is the following object:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{$k$-star} is a star polygon of type $\left\{\frac{2k+1}{k}\right\}$.
\end{definition}

\caption{\small{Star polygons of type $\{5/2\}$, $\{8/3\}$ and $\{11/5\}$.}}\label{starpolygons}
\end{figure}

The main goal of this paper is to study $k$-triangulations as complexes of $k$-stars. Using this new tool, we get the first direct proof of property (i) (section \ref{sectioncomplexes}). Moreover, we obtain a simple description of flips, and consequently, an easy direct ({\it i.e.} non recursive) proof of (iii) (section \ref{sectionflips}). In section \ref{sectionflatinflat}, we present a new interpretation of (iv) as the flattening of a $k$-star. Then, we prove directly (ii), and we discuss the equality case (section \ref{sectionears}).
Finally, we discuss in section \ref{sectionopen} further topics that may be easier when using $k$-stars.

\section{Notation}\label{sectionnotation}

Let $k$ and $n$ be two integers such that $k\ge 1$ and $n\ge 2k+1$.

Let $V_n$ be the \emph{set of vertices of an $n$-gon}, {\it i.e.} any set of points of the unit circle, labelled counterclockwise by the cyclic set $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
All throughout the paper, we will refer to the points in $V_n$ by their labels to simplify notation.
For $u,v,w\in V_n$, we will denote $u\cl v\cl w$ the cyclic order inherited from $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
For any $u,v\in V_n$, let $\llbracket u,v\rrbracket$ denote the \emph{cyclic interval} $\{w\in V_n\;|\; u\cle w\cle v\}$.
The intervals $\rrbracket u,v\llbracket$, $\llbracket u,v\llbracket$ and $\rrbracket u,v\rrbracket$ are defined similarly.
Let $|u-v|=\min(|\llbracket u, v\llbracket|,|\llbracket v, u\llbracket|)$ be the \emph{cyclic distance} between $u$ and $v$.

For $u\ne v\in V_n$, let $[u,v]$ denote the \emph{edge} connecting the vertices $u$ and $v$. We say that $[u,v]$ is of \emph{length} $|u-v|$.
Let $E_n={V_n \choose 2}$ be the \emph{set of edges of the $n$-gon}.
Two edges $[u,v]$ and $[u',v']$ are said to be \emph{intersecting} when the open segments $]u,v[$ and $]u',v'[$ are intersecting.
For $\ell\in\mathbb{N}$, an \emph{$\ell$-crossing} is a set of $\ell$ mutually intersecting edges.
A \emph{$k$-triangulation} of the $n$-gon is a maximal $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset of $E_n$.

Obviously, an edge $[u,v]$ of $E_n$ can appear in a $(k+1)$-crossing only if $|u-v|>k$. We say that such an edge is \emph{$k$-relevant}. We say that an edge $[u,v]$ is a \emph{$k$-boundary} if $|u-v|=k$ and is \emph{$k$-irrelevant} if $|u-v|<k$.
Every $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon contains all the $(k-1)n$ $k$-irrelevant edges and all the $n$ $k$-boundary edges of the $n$-gon and some $k$-relevant edges.

An \emph{angle} of a subset $E$ of $E_n$ is a pair of edges $\angle(u,v,w)=\{[u,v],[v,w]\}$ of $E$ such that $u\cl v\cl w$ and for all $t\in\rrbracket w,u\llbracket$, the edge $[v,t]$ is not in $E$. The vertex $v$ is the \emph{vertex} of $\angle(u,v,w)$. Any $t\in\rrbracket w,u\llbracket$ is said to be \emph{contained} in $\angle(u,v,w)$, and the edge $[v,t]$ is a \emph{bisector} of $\angle(u,v,w)$.
The bisectors of $E$ are the bisectors of all the angles of $E$.
An angle is said to be \emph{$k$-relevant} if its edges are either $k$-relevant or $k$-boundary edges.

Finally, observe that there are two natural cyclic orders on the vertices of a $k$-star $S$: the \emph{circle order}, defined as the cyclic order around the circle, and the \emph{star order}, defined as the cyclic order tracing the edges of $S$. More precisely, if $s_0,\ldots,s_{2k}$ are the vertices of $S$ cyclically ordered around the circle, we rename the vertices $r_i=s_{iq}$ to obtain the star order $r_0,\ldots,r_{2k}$.

\section{Mutual positions of $k$-stars}\label{sectionstars}

In this section, we study the mutual positions of two $k$-stars $R$ and $S$ of a $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset $E$ of $E_n$.

\begin{lemma}\label{starangles}
Any angle of $S$ is an angle of $E$ and is $k$-relevant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $V=\{s_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ denote the vertices of $S$ in star order.
Suppose that $E$ contains an edge $[s_j,t]$ where $j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}$ and $t\in\rrbracket s_{j+1},s_{j-1}\llbracket$. Then the set of edges $$[s_{j+1},s_{j+2}],[s_{j+3},s_{j+4}],\ldots,[s_{j-2},s_{j-1}],[s_j,t]$$ forms a $(k+1)$-crossing. Thus $\angle(s_{j-1},s_j,s_{j+1})$ is an angle of $E$.

Since any edge of $S$ separates the other vertices of $S$ into two parts of size $k-1$ and $k$, it is at least a $k$-boundary. Consequently, the angle $\angle(s_{j-1},s_j,s_{j+1})$ is $k$-relevant.
\end{proof}

Note that this lemma implies that the knowledge of one angle $\angle(s_{j-1},s_j,s_{j+1})$ of $S$ permits the recovery of all the $k$-star $S$: the vertex $s_{j+2}$ is the unique vertex such that $\angle(s_j,s_{j+1},s_{j+2})$ is an angle of $E$ ({\it i.e.} the first neighbour of $s_{j+1}$ after $s_j$ when moving clockwise), and so on.
In particular, we get the following corollary.

\begin{corollary}
$R$ and $S$ can not share any angle.
\end{corollary}

Since the number of edges of a $k$-star is $2k+1$, this implies that $R$ and $S$ can not share more than $k$ edges. Note that they may share $k$ edges (for example, the two $k$-stars of the graph obtained from the complete graph on $2k+2$ vertices by omitting the diagonal $[0,k+1]$ share all the $k$  other diagonals).

\begin{corollary}
For any edge $[u,v]$ of $E$, the number $|\llbracket u,v\rrbracket\cap V|$ of vertices of $S$ between $u$ and $v$ and the number $|\llbracket v,u\rrbracket\cap V|$ of vertices of $S$ between $v$ and $u$ can not be equal.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $S$ has the same number of vertices on both sides of an edge $f=[u,v]$. Since the number of vertices of $S$ is $2k+1$, one of the two vertices of $f$ is a vertex of $S$, say $u$. Then $v$ is contained in the angle of $S$ of vertex $u$, which implies that $f$ is not in $E$.
\end{proof}

If $|\llbracket u,v\rrbracket\cap V|>|\llbracket v,u\rrbracket\cap V|$, then we say that the $k$-star $S$ lies \emph{between} $u$ and $v$ (otherwise we say that $S$ lies between $v$ and $u$). 
The $k$-star $S$ is said to be contained in an angle $\angle(u,v,w)$ of $E$ if it lies between $v$ and $u$ and between $w$ and $v$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\angle(u,v,w)$ be an angle of $E$ containing the $k$-star $S$. Then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item either $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle of $S$;
\item or $\angle(u,v,w)$ and $S$ have a common bisector (and $v$ is not a vertex of $S$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose first that $v$ is a vertex of $S$. Let $\angle(x,v,y)$ denote the angle of $S$ of vertex $v$. Since $\angle(u,v,w)$ contains $S$, we have $w\cle y\cl x\cle u$. But since $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle, we have $x=u$ and $y=w$, so that $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle of $S$.

Suppose now that $v$ is not a vertex of $S$. Then there exists an angle $\angle(x,y,z)$ of $S$ containing $v$. If $y\in\rrbracket u,v\llbracket$, then $\rrbracket u,v\llbracket$ contains all the $k+1$ vertices of $S$ between $y$ and $z$, which is not possible (because $S$ lies between $v$ and $u$). If $y=u$, then $[u,v]$ is a bisector of $\angle(x,y,z)$, which contradicts lemma \ref{starangles}. Similarly, $y$ can not be in $\rrbracket v,w\rrbracket$. Consequently, $\angle(u,v,w)$ contains $y$, so that $[v,y]$ is a common bisector of $\angle(u,v,w)$ and $S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{common bisector}
Every pair of $k$-stars contained in a $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset of $E_n$ have a unique common bisector.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\{r_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ denote the vertices of $R$ in star order. Note that for any $j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}$, if $S$ lies between $r_{j-1}$ and $r_j$, then it lies between $r_{j+1}$ and $r_j$. Since $2k+1$ is odd, this implies that there exists $j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}$ such that $S$ lies between $r_j$ and $r_{j-1}$ and between $r_{j+1}$ and $r_j$, {\it i.e.} in the angle $\angle(r_{j-1},r_j,r_{j+1})$.The previous lemma thus ensures the existence of a common bisector.

Suppose now that we have two common bisectors $e$ and $f$  of $R$ and $S$, and let $\{r_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ and $\{s_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ denote the vertices of $R$ and $S$ in star order such that $e=[r_0,s_0]$. Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}$ such that $f=[r_a,s_b]$.
Note that certainly, $a\ne0$, $b\ne0$, and $a$ and $b$ have the same parity. By symmetry, we can assume that $a=2\alpha$, $b=2\beta$ with $1\le\beta\le\alpha\le k$. But then the set
$$\{[r_{2i},r_{2i+1}]\;|\; 0\le i\le \alpha-1\}\cup\{[s_{2j},s_{2j+1}]\;|\; \beta\le j\le k\}$$
forms a $(k+1+\alpha-\beta)$-crossing, and $k+1+\alpha-\beta\ge k+1$. This proves uniqueness.\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{combisector.eps}}
\caption{\small{The common bisector of two $2$-stars (left) and a $2$-crossing that crosses it (right).}}\label{combisector}
\end{figure}

In the following lemmas, $\{r_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ and $\{s_j\;|\; j\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}\}$ denote the vertices of $R$ and $S$, in star order, and such that $e=[r_0,s_0]$ is the common bisector of $R$ and $S$.

\begin{lemma}\label{paralleledges}
For every $1\le i\le k$, $r_{2i-1}\in\rrbracket r_0,s_{2i}\rrbracket$ and $s_{2i-1}\in\rrbracket s_0,r_{2i}\rrbracket$.
In particular, for every $i\in\mathbb{Z}_{2k+1}$ the edges $[r_i,r_{i+1}]$ and $[s_i,s_{i+1}]$ do not cross.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that there exists $1\le i\le k$ such that $r_{2i-1}\in\rrbracket s_{2i},s_0\llbracket$ or $s_{2i-1}\in\rrbracket r_{2i},r_0\llbracket$. Let $\gamma$ be the highest such integer, and assume for example that $r_{2\gamma-1}\in\rrbracket s_{2\gamma},s_0\llbracket$. Then the definition of $\gamma$ ensures that
$s_0\cl s_{2\gamma+1}\le r_{2\gamma}\cl r_{2\gamma-2}$
so that the set
$$\{[r_{2i},r_{2i+1}]\;|\; 0\le i\le\gamma-1\}\cup\{[s_{2j},s_{2j+1}]\;|\; \gamma\le j\le k\}$$
forms a $(k+1)$-crossing.
\end{proof}

The previous lemma can be read as saying that corresponding edges of $R$ and $S$ are parallel. It is easy to see that $k$ of these $2k+1$ pairs of parallel edges, the ones of the form $([r_{2i-1},r_{2i}],[s_{2i-1},s_{2i}])$, with $1\le i\le k$, separate $R$ from $S$. The next lemma says that any $k$-crossing that crosses the common bissector $e=[r_0,s_0]$ has one edge parallel to and between each such pair (see fig. \ref{combisector}).

\begin{lemma}\label{sandwich}
Let $F$ be a $k$-crossing of $E$ such that any of its edges crosses $e=[r_0,s_0]$. Let $f_1=[x_1,y_1],\ldots,f_k=[x_k,y_k]$ denote its edges such that $r_0\cl x_1\cl \ldots\cl x_k\cl s_0\cl y_1\cl \ldots\cl y_k\cl r_0$.
Then for any $1\le i\le k$, we have $x_i\in\llbracket r_{2k-2i+1},s_{2k-2i+2}\rrbracket$ and $y_i\in\llbracket s_{2k-2i+1},r_{2k-2i+2}\rrbracket$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that there exists $1\le i\le k$ such that $r_0\cl x_i\cl r_{2k-2i+1}$ and let
$$\ell=\max\{1\le i\le k \;|\; r_0\cl x_i\cl r_{2k-2i+1}\}.$$
If $\ell=k$, then the set $\{e_1,\ldots,e_k,[r_0,r_1]\}$ is a $(k+1)$-crossing of $T$, thus we assume that $\ell<k$. In order for $$\{e_1,\ldots,e_\ell\}\cup\{[r_0,r_1],\ldots,[r_{2k-2\ell},r_{2k-2\ell+1}]\}$$ not to be a $(k+1)$-crossing, we have $r_{2k-2\ell}\cle y_\ell\cl r_0$, so that $r_{2k-2\ell}\cl y_{\ell+1}\cl r_0$. But the definition of $\ell$ implies that $r_{2k-2\ell+1}\cl r_{2k-2\ell-1}\cle x_{\ell+1}\cl s_0$, so that
the set $$\{[r_{2k-2\ell},r_{2k-2\ell+1}],\ldots,[r_{2k-2},r_{2k-1}],[r_{2k},r_0]\}\cup\{e_{\ell+1},\ldots,e_k\}$$ is a $(k+1)$-crossing of $T$.

By symmetry, the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

The following lemma is at the heart of the concept of flips to be studied further in section \ref{sectionflips}.

\begin{lemma}\label{commonedge}
Let $f$ be a common edge of $R$ and $S$. Then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item there exists $1\le i\le k$ such that $f=[r_{2i-1},r_{2i}]=[s_{2i},s_{2i-1}]$;
\item $E\triangle\{e,f\}$ is a $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset of $E_n$;
\item the vertices $$s_0,\ldots,s_{2i-2},s_{2i-1}=r_{2i},r_{2i+1},\ldots,r_{2k},r_0$$
(resp. $r_0,\ldots,r_{2i-2},r_{2i-1}=s_{2i},s_{2i+1},\ldots,s_{2k},s_0$) are the vertices of a $k$-star $X$ (resp. $Y$) of $E\triangle\{e,f\}$, in star order;
\item $X$ and $Y$ share the edge $e$ and their common bisector is $f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{flip.eps}}
\caption{\small{The flip of an edge.}}\label{flip}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Let $u$ and $v$ denote the vertices of $f$.
Lemma \ref{paralleledges} ensures that $\{r_0,s_0\}\cap\{u,v\}=\emptyset$ so that we can assume $r_0\cl u\cl s_0\cl v\cl r_0$. Consequently, there exists $1\le i,j\le k$ such that $u=r_{2i-1}=s_{2j}$ and $v=r_{2i}=s_{2j-1}$. Suppose that $i>j$. Then according to  lemma \ref{paralleledges}, we have $r_0\cl r_{2i-1}\cle s_{2i}\cl s_{2j}=r_{2i-1}$ which is impossible. We obtain that $i=j$ and $f=[r_{2i-1},r_{2i}]=[s_{2i},s_{2i-1}]$.

Lemma \ref{sandwich} then proves that any $k$-crossing of $T$ that prevent $e$ being in $T$ contains $f$, so that $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ does not contain any $(k+1)$-crossing.

Moreover, for any $1\le j\le p$, the number of vertices of the set $\{s_0,\ldots,s_{2i-2},r_{2i},\ldots,r_{2k},r_0\}$ between $s_{2j-2}$ and $s_{2j-1}$ (resp. $r_{2j}$ and $r_{2j+1}$, resp. $r_0$ and $s_0$) is obviously $k-1$. This implies that the vertices $s_0,\ldots,s_{2i-2},r_{2i},\ldots,r_{2k},r_0$ are in star order. The point (iii) thus follows from the fact that any edge connecting two consecutive points of this list is in $E\triangle\{e,f\}$.

The edge $e$ is clearly common to $X$ and $Y$. The edge $f$ is a bisector of both angles $\angle(r_{2i-2},r_{2j-1},s_{2i+1})$ and $\angle(s_{2i-2},s_{2j-1},r_{2i+1})$, so that it is the common bisector of $X$ and $Y$.
\end{proof}

\section{$k$-triangulations as complexes of $k$-stars}\label{sectioncomplexes}

In this section, $T$ is a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon, {\it i.e.} a maximal $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset of $E_n$.

\begin{theorem}\label{angle}
Any $k$-relevant angle of a $k$-triangulation $T$ belongs to a unique $k$-star of $T$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
In this proof, we need the following definition (see fig. \ref{farther}): let $\angle(u,v,w)$ be a $k$-relevant angle of $T$ and let $e$ and $f$ be two edges of $T$ that \emph{intersect} $\angle(u,v,w)$ ({\it i.e.} that intersect both $[u,v]$ and $[v,w]$). If $a,b,c$ and $d$ denote their vertices such that $u\cl a\cl v\cl b\cl w$ and $u\cl c\cl v\cl d\cl w$, then we say that $e=[a,b]$ is \emph{$v$-farther} than $f=[c,d]$ if $u\cl a\cle c\cl v\cl d\cle b\cl w$. Let $E$ and $F$ be two $(k-1)$-crossings that \emph{intersect} $\angle(u,v,w)$. Let their edges be labelled $e_1=[a_1,b_1],e_2=[a_2,b_2],\ldots,e_{k-1}=[a_{k-1},b_{k-1}]$ and $f_1=[c_1,d_1],f_2=[c_2,d_2],\ldots,f_{k-1}=[c_{k-1},d_{k-1}]$ such that $u\cl a_1\cl a_2\cl \ldots\cl a_{k-1}\cl v\cl b_1\cl b_2\cl \ldots\cl b_{k-1}\cl w$ and $u\cl c_1\cl c_2\cl \ldots\cl c_{k-1}\cl v\cl d_1\cl d_2\cl \ldots\cl d_{k-1}\cl w$. Then we say that $E$ is \emph{$v$-farther} than $F$ if $e_i$ is $v$-farther than $f_i$ for every $1\le i\le k-1$. We say that $E$ is \emph{$v$-maximal} if it does not exist any $(k-1)$-crossing intersecting $\angle(u,v,w)$ and $v$-farther than $E$

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{farther.eps}}
\caption{\small{$[a,b]$ is $v$-farther than $[c,d]$ (left) and $\{[a_i,b_i]\}$ is $v$-farther than $\{[c_i,d_i]\}$ (right).}}\label{farther}
\end{figure}

Let $\angle(u,v,w)$ be a $k$-relevant angle of $T$. 
If the edge $[u,v+1]$ is in $T$, then the angle $\angle(v+1,u,v)$ is a $k$-relevant angle of $T$ and, if it is contained in a $k$-star $S$ of $T$, then so is $\angle(u,v,w)$. Moreover, if $n>2k+1$ ($n=2k+1$ is a trivial case), $T$ can not contain all the edges $\{[u+i,v+i]\;|\; i=0\ldots n-1\}$ and $\{[u+i,v+i+1]\;|\; i=0\ldots n-1\}$. Consequently, we can assume that $[u,v+1]$ is not in $T$.

Thus we have a $k$-crossing $E$ of the form $e_1=[a_1,b_1],\ldots,e_k=[a_k,b_k]$ with $u\cl a_1\cl \ldots\cl a_k\cl v+1$ and $v+1\cl b_1\cl \ldots\cl b_k\cl u$. Since $[u,v]\in T$, $a_k=v$ and since $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle, $v+1\cl b_k\cle w$. Consequently, $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$ forms a $(k-1)$-crossing intersecting $\angle(u,v,w)$ and we can assume that it is $v$-maximal (see fig. \ref{twosteps} (a)). We will prove that the edges $[u,b_1], [a_1,b_2],\ldots, [a_{k-2},b_{k-1}],[a_{k-1},w]$ are in $T$ such that the points $u$, $a_1,\ldots,a_{k-1}$, $v$, $b_1,\ldots,b_{k-1}$, $w$ are the vertices of a $k$-star of $T$ containing the angle $\angle(u,v,w)$. To get this result, we use two steps: first we prove that $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$ is an angle of $T$, and then we prove that the edges $e_2,\ldots,e_{k-1},[v,w]$ form a $(k-1)$-crossing intersecting $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$ and $b_1$-maximal (so that we can reiterate the argument).

\medskip
\noindent\textsc{First step.}  (see fig. \ref{twosteps} (b))

Suppose that $[u,b_1]$ is not in $T$. Thus we have a $k$-crossing $F$ that prevents the edge $[u,b_1]$. Let $f_1=[c_1,d_1],\ldots,f_k=[c_k,d_k]$ denote its edges with $u\cl c_1\cl \ldots\cl c_k\cl b_1$ and $b_1\cl d_1\cl \ldots\cl d_k\cl u$.

Note first that $v\cl d_k\cle w$. Indeed, if it is not the case, then $d_k\in\rrbracket w,u\llbracket$ and $c_k\ne v$, because $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle. Thus either $c_k\in\rrbracket u,v\llbracket$ and  then $F\cup\{[u,v]\}$ forms a $(k+1)$-crossing, or $c_k\in\rrbracket v,b_1\llbracket$ and  then $E\cup\{[c_k,d_k]\}$ forms a $(k+1)$-crossing. Consequently, we have $b_1\cl d_1\cl \ldots\cl d_{k-1}\cl w$.

Let $\ell=\max\{1\le i\le {k-1}\;|\; b_i\cl d_i\cl w\}$. Then for any $1\le i\le\ell$, since $\{e_1,\ldots,e_i\}\cup\{f_i,\ldots,f_k\}$ does not form a $(k+1)$-crossing, we have $u\cl c_i\cle a_i$. Thus for any $1\le i\le\ell$, $u\cl c_i\cle a_i\cl v\cl b_i\cl d_i\cl w$, so that $f_i$ is $v$-farther than $e_i$. Furthermore, we have $u\cl c_1\cl \ldots\cl c_\ell\cl a_{\ell+1}\cl\ldots\cl a_{k-1}\cl v\cl d_1\cl\ldots\cl d_\ell\cl b_{\ell+1}\cl \ldots\cl b_{k-1}\cl w$. Consequently, we get a $(k-1)$-crossing $\{f_1,\ldots,f_\ell,e_{\ell+1},\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$ which is $v$-farther than $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$; this contradicts the definition of $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$. Thus we obtain $[u,b_1]\in T$.

Suppose now that $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$ is not an angle of $T$ then there exists $a_0\in \rrbracket u,a_1\llbracket$ such that $[b_1,a_0]\in T$. But then the $(k-1)$-crossing $\{[a_0,b_1],e_2,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$ is $v$-farther than $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$, so that $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$ is an angle of $T$.
\begin{figure}

\caption{\small{(a) the $k$-crossing $E$; (b) First step: $[u,b_1]\in T$; (c) Second step: $\{e_2,\ldots,e_{k-1},[v,w]\}$ is $b_1$-maximal.}}\label{twosteps}
\end{figure}

\medskip
\noindent\textsc{Second step.} (see fig. \ref{twosteps} (c))

Let $F$ be a $(k-1)$-crossing intersecting $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$ and $b_1$-farther than the $(k-1)$-crossing $\{e_2,\ldots,e_{k-1},[v,w]\}$. Let $f_2=[c_2,d_2],\ldots,f_k=[c_k,d_k]$ denote its edges such that $a_1\cl c_2\cl \ldots\cl c_k\cl b_1\cl d_2\cl \ldots\cl d_k\cl u$. 

Note first that $b_k\cle d_k\cle w$. Indeed, if it is not the case, then $d_k\in\rrbracket w,u\llbracket$ and $c_k\ne v$, because $\angle(u,v,w)$ is an angle. Thus either $c_k\in\rrbracket a_1,v\llbracket$ and  then $F\cup\{[u,v],e_1\}$ forms a $(k+1)$-crossing, or $c_k\in\rrbracket v,b_1\llbracket$ and  then $E\cup\{[c_k,d_k]\}$ forms a $(k+1)$-crossing. Consequently, we have $b_1\cl d_2\cl\ldots\cl d_{k-1}\cl w$.

Furthermore, for any $2\le i\le k-1$, $f_i$ is $\angle(a_1,b_1,u)$-farther than $e_i$, so that $a_1\cl c_i\cle a_i\cl b_1\cl b_i\cle d_i\cl u$. In particular, $a_1\cl c_{k-1}\cle a_{k-1}\cl v$ and we get $u\cl a_1\cl c_2\cl\ldots\cl c_{k-1}\cl v\cl b_1\cl d_2\cl \ldots\cl d_{k-1}\cl w$. Consequently, the $(k-1)$-crossing $\{e_1,f_2,\ldots,f_{k-1}\}$ is $v$-farther than $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}\}$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

The following easy corollary of theorem \ref{angle} justifies the title of this paper.

\begin{corollary}\label{incidences}
Let $e$ be an edge of $T$. Then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $e$ is a $k$-relevant edge, then it belongs to exactly two $k$-stars of $T$ (one on each side);
\item if $e$ is a $k$-boundary edge, then it belongs to exactly one $k$-star of $T$ (on its inner side); \item if $e$ is a $k$-irrelevant edge, then it does not belong to any $k$-star of $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{findingstars}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any $k$-star $S$ of $T$ and for any vertex $r$ not in $S$ there is a unique $k$-star $R$ of $T$ such that $r$ is a vertex of the common bisector of $R$ and $S$.
\item Any $k$-relevant edge which is not in $T$ is the common bisector of a unique pair of $k$-stars of $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $\angle(u,s,v)$ be the unique angle of $S$ which contains $r$. Let $\angle(x,r,y)$ be the unique angle of $T$ of vertex $r$ which contains $s$. According to theorem \ref{angle}, the angle $\angle(x,r,y)$ belongs to a unique $k$-star $R$. The common bisector of $R$ and $S$ is $[r,s]$ and $R$ is the only such $k$-star of $T$.

Let $e=[r,s]$ be a $k$-relevant edge, not in $T$. Let $\angle(x,r,y)$ (resp. $\angle(u,s,v)$) denote the unique angle of $T$ of vertex $r$ (resp. $s$) which contains $s$ (resp. $r$). According to theorem \ref{angle}, the angle $\angle(x,r,y)$ (resp. $\angle(u,s,v)$) belongs to a unique $k$-star $R$ (resp. $S$). The common bisector of $R$ and $S$ is $[r,s]$ and $(R,S)$ is the only such couple of $k$-stars of $T$.
\end{proof}

Observe that parts (1) and (2) of this lemma give bijections from 
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``vertices not used in a $k$-star $S$ of $T$" and ``$k$-stars of $T$ distinct from $S$";
\item ``$k$-relevant edges not used in $T$" and ``pairs of $k$-stars of $T$".
\end{enumerate}
From any of these bijections, and using corollary \ref{incidences} for double counting, it is easy to derive the number of $k$-stars and $k$-relevant edges in $T$:

\begin{corollary}\label{starsenumeration}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon contains exactly $n-2k$ $k$-stars, $k(n-2k-1)$ $k$-relevant edges and $k(2n-2k-1)$ edges.
\item The $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon are exactly the $(k+1)$-crossing free subsets of $E_n$ of cardinality $k(2n-2k-1)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\section{The graph of flips}\label{sectionflips}

Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon, let $f$ be a $k$-relevant edge of $T$, let $R$ and $S$ be the two $k$-stars of $T$ containing $f$ (corollary \ref{incidences}), and let $e$ be the common bisector of $R$ and $S$. Remind that we proved (lemma \ref{commonedge}) that $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ is a $(k+1)$-crossing-free subset of $E_n$. Observe moreover that $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ is maximal: this follows from corollary \ref{starsenumeration}, but also from the fact that if $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ is properly contained in a $k$-triangulation $\widetilde{T}$, then $\widetilde{T}\triangle\{e,f\}$ is $(k+1)$-crossing-free and properly contains $T$. Thus $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ is a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon.

\begin{lemma}\label{flip}
$T$ and $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ are the only two $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon contaning $T\setminus\{f\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $e'$ be any edge of $E_n\setminus T$ distinct from $e$. Let $R'$ and $S'$ be the two $k$-stars with common bisector $e'$ (lemma \ref{findingstars} (2)). We can assume that $R'$ does not contain $f$ and then $R'\cup\{e'\}$ is contained in $T\triangle\{e',f\}$ and forms a $(k+1)$-crossing.
\end{proof}

We say that we obtain the $k$-triangulation $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ from the $k$-triangulation $T$ by \emph{flipping} the edge $f$. The $k$-triangulations $T$ and $T\triangle\{e,f\}$ are said to be \emph{flip-neighbours}. The added edge $e$ is denoted by $e(T,f)$.

Let $G_{n,k}$ be the graph of flip-neighbours on the set of $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon, {\it i.e.} the graph whose vertices are the $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon and whose edges are the pairs of flip-neighbour $k$-triangulations.

In this section, we prove the connexity of this graph.

\medskip
Note that $e$ and $f$ necessarily cross.
In particular, if $e=[\alpha,\beta]$ and $f=[\gamma,\delta]$, with $0\cle\alpha\cl\beta\cle n-1$ and $0\cle\gamma\cl\delta\cle n-1$, then
\begin{itemize}
\item either $0\cle\alpha\cl\gamma\cl\beta\cl\delta\cle n-1$ and the flip is said to be \emph{slope-decreasing},
\item or $0\cle\gamma\cl\alpha\cl\delta\cl\beta\cle n-1$ and the flip is said to be \emph{slope-increasing}.
\end{itemize}
We define a partial order on the set of $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon as follows: if $T$ and $T'$ are two $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon, $T<T'$ if and only if there exists a sequence of slope-increasing flips from $T$ to $T'$ (if and only if there exists a sequence of slope-decreasing flips from $T'$ to $T$).

Let $T_{n,k}^{\min}$ be the $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon whose set of $k$-relevant edges is $\{[i,j]\;|\;i\in\llbracket 0,k-1\rrbracket\;\mathrm{and}\;j\in\llbracket i+k,i-k\rrbracket\}$ (see fig. \ref{min}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{min.eps}}
\caption{\small{The triangulation $T_{11,3}^{\min}$.}}\label{min}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}\label{connexity}
For any $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon $T\ne T_{n,k}^{\min}$, there exists a $k$-relevant edge $f\in T\setminus T_{n,k}^{\min}$ such that $e(T,f)\in T_{n,k}^{\min}\setminus T$.

In particular, $T_{n,k}^{\min}$ is the least element of the set of $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon partially ordered by $<$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since the second point is an immediate corollary of the first one, we only have to prove the first point.

Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon distinct from $T_{n,k}^{min}$. Let
$$\ell=\max\{k\le i\le n-k+1\;|\;\{[0,i],[1,i+1],\ldots,[k-1,i+k-1]\}\nsubseteq T\},$$
which exists because $T\ne T_{n,k}^{min}$.

Let $0\le j\le k-1$ such that the edge $[j,\ell+j]$ is not in $T$. Let $\{[x_1,y_1],\ldots,[x_k,y_k]\}$ denote a $k$-crossing that prevent $[j,\ell+j]$ to be in $T$, with the convention that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $x_1\cl \ldots\cl x_k\cl y_1\cl \ldots\cl y_k$,
\item if $j>0$, then $j\in\rrbracket x_j,x_{j+1}\llbracket$ and $\ell+j\in\rrbracket y_j,y_{j+1}\llbracket$,
\item if $j=0$, then $0\in\rrbracket y_k,x_1\llbracket$ and $\ell+j\in\rrbracket x_k,y_1\llbracket$.
\end{enumerate}
With this convention, we are sure that $x_k\in\llbracket k,\ell-1\rrbracket$ and $y_k\in\llbracket \ell+k,n-1\rrbracket$. If $y_k\in \rrbracket \ell+k,n-1\rrbracket$, then the set
$$\{[0,\ell],\ldots,[k-1,\ell+k],[x_k,y_k]\}$$
is a $(k+1)$-crossing of $T$. Thus $y_k=\ell+k$, and there exists an edge $[x_k,\ell+k]$ with $x_k\in\llbracket k,\ell-1\rrbracket$.

Now let $m=\min\{k\le i\le \ell-1\;|\; [i,\ell+k]\in T\}$. Let $f$ be the edge $[m,\ell+k]$, let $S$ be the $k$-star containing the angle $\angle(m,\ell+k,k-1)$ and let $R$ be the other $k$-star containing $f$. Let $s_0, \ldots,s_{k-2},s_{k-1}=k-1,s_k=m,s_{k+1},\ldots,s_{2k-1},s_{2k}=\ell+k$ denote the vertices of the $k$-star $S$ in circle order. Then $s_0\in\llbracket \ell+k+1, 0\rrbracket$, and the only way not to get a $(k+1)$-crossing is to have $s_0=0$. This implies that $s_j=j$ for all $0\le j\le k-1$. 

Let $e=e(T,f)$ be the common bisector of $R$ and $S$ and $s$ denote its vertex in $S$. Since $f=[m,\ell+k]=[s_k,s_{2k}]$ is a common edge of $R$ and $S$, it is obvious that $s\notin\{s_k,s_{2k}\}$. Moreover, since for any $0\le j\le k-1$ the interval $\rrbracket s_j,s_{j+1}\llbracket$ is empty, $s\notin\{s_{k+1},s_{k+2},\ldots,s_{2k-1}\}$. Consequently, $s\in\{s_0,\ldots,s_{k-1}\}=\llbracket 0,k-1\rrbracket$ and $e\in T_{n,k}^{\min}\setminus T$.
\end{proof}

Obviously, we get symetric results with the $k$-triangulation $T_{n,k}^{\max}$ whose set of $k$-relevant edges is $\{[i,j]\;|\;i\in\llbracket n-k,n-1\rrbracket\;\mathrm{and}\;j\in\llbracket i+k,i-k\rrbracket\}$.

\begin{corollary}
The graph $G_{n,k}$ is connected, regular of degree $k(n-2k-1)$, and its diameter is at most $2k(n-2k-1)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon. The regularity follows from the fact that any of the $k(n-2k-1)$ $k$-relevant edges of $T$ can be flipped. Moreover, the previous lemma ensures that there exists a sequence of at most $k(n-2k-1)$ slope-decreasing flips from $T$ to $T_{n,k}^{\min}$. Thus any pair of $k$-triangulations is linked by a path of lenght at most $2k(n-2k-1)$ passing through $T_{n,k}^{\min}$.
\end{proof}

Obviously we would obtain the same result with any rotation of the labelling of $V_n$. In particular, for any pair $\{T,T'\}$ of $k$-triangulations, we can choose the intermediate $k$-triangulation $T''$ for our path among any rotation of $T_{n,k}^{\min}$. Consequently, there exists a path linking $T$ and $T'$ of length smaller than the average of $|T\triangle T''|+|T''\triangle T'|$ (for $T''$ among the rotations of $T_{n,k}^{\min}$). As proved in \cite{n-gdfcp-00}, the diameter upper bound can thus be improved to be $2kn-(8k^2+2k)$ when $n>8k^3+4k^2$.

Note that even if the improvement is asymptotically not relevant, for the case $k=1$, the improved bound of $2n-10$ is actually the exact diameter of the associahedron \cite{stt-rdthg-88}. For $k>1$, we only have the following lower bound:

\begin{lemma}\label{diamin}
If $n\ge 4k$, then the diameter of $G_{n,k}$ is at least $k(n-2k-1)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We only have to find two $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon with no $k$-relevant edges in common. Let $Z$ be the subset of $k$-relevant edges of $E_n$ defined by
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z & = & \left\{[q-1,-q-k]\;|\; 1\le q\le \lfloor n/2-k\rfloor\right\}\\
&&\cup\left\{[q,-q-k]\;|\; 1\le q\le \lfloor (n-1)/2-k\rfloor\right\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
We say that $Z$ is a \emph{$k$-zigzag} of $E_n$ (see fig. \ref{zigzags}). Let $\rho$ be the rotation $t\mapsto t+1$. Observe that since $n\ge 4k$, the $2k$ $k$-zigzags $Z,\rho(Z),\ldots,\rho^{2k-1}(Z)$ are disjoint. Moreover,
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item there is no $2$-crossing in a $k$-zigzag, so that there is no $(k+1)$-crossing in the union of $k$ $k$-zigzags;
\item a $k$-zigzag contains $n-2k-1$ $k$-relevant edges, so that the disjoint union of $k$ $k$-zigzags contains $k(n-2k-1)$ $k$-relevant edges.
\end{enumerate}
According to corollary \ref{starsenumeration}, this proves that the disjoint union of $k$ $k$-zigzag is the set of $k$-relevant edges of a $k$-triangulation. Thus, we obtain the two $k$-triangulations we were looking for with the sets of $k$-relevant edges $\bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1} \rho^i(Z)$ and $\bigcup_{i=k}^{2k-1} \rho^i(Z)$.
\begin{figure}

\caption{\small{Examples of $k$-zigzags of $E_n$ for $(k,n)=(2,10)$ and $(3,21)$.}}\label{zigzags}
\end{figure}
\end{proof}

Finally, observe that lemma \ref{connexity} gives another proof of the number of edges (and consequently of $k$-stars) in a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon. This method is the one that is used in \cite{n-gdfcp-00} and \cite{dkm-lahp-02}.

\section{$k$-ears and $k$-colorable $k$-triangulations}\label{sectionears}


Let assume that $n\ge 2k+3$. We call \emph{$k$-ear} any edge of length $k+1$. We say that a $k$-star is \emph{internal} if it does not contain any $k$-boundary edges.
It is well known that the number of ears of any triangulation equals its number of internal triangles plus $2$. In this section, we first prove that the number of $k$-ears of any $k$-triangulation equals its number of internal $k$-stars plus $2k$. Then we characterize the triangulations that have no internal $k$-star.

If $S$ is a $k$-star and $[u,v]$ is an edge of $S$, we call \emph{$S$-interior length} of $[u,v]$ the cardinality of the one of the cyclic intervals $\llbracket u,v\llbracket$ and $\llbracket v,u\llbracket$ that contains $k+1$ vertices of $S$, and \emph{$S$-exterior length} of $[u,v]$ the cardinality of the other interval.
We call \emph{$S$-interior boundary} (resp. \emph{ear}) an edge of $S$ of $S$-interior length $k$ (resp. $k+1$).
Note that the length of an edge of $S$ is the minimum of its $S$-interior and $S$-exterior lengths. In particular, an edge of $S$ is 
\begin{itemize}
\item a $k$-boundary edge if and only if it is an $S$-interior boundary;
\item a $k$-ear  if and only if it is either an $S$-interior ear or an $S$-exterior ear.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\label{starwithboundary}
Let $S$ be any $k$-star of $E_n$ containing a $k$-boundary edge and let $e_0,\ldots,e_{2k}$ denote its edges in star order. Then there exists $0\le p\le 2k$ and $0\le q\le k$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $e_p,e_{p+2},\ldots,e_{p+2q}$ are $k$-boundary edges (consecutive around the circle);
\item $e_{p+1},e_{p+3},\ldots,e_{p+2q-1}$ are $S$-interior ears (consecutive around the circle);
\item $e_{p+2q+1},\ldots,e_{p+2k}$ have $S$-interior length at least $k+2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be the set of vertices of $S$. Let $\llbracket a,b\rrbracket$ be the biggest cyclic interval contained in $V$. Since $S$ contains a $k$-boundary edge, $|\llbracket a,b\rrbracket|\ge k+1$. Let $p$ be such that $e_p=[b,b-k]$ and let $q=|\llbracket a,b\rrbracket|-k-1$.
Then for any $1\le i\le q$, we have $e_{p+2i-1}=[b-i+1,b-k-i]$ and $e_{p+2i}=[b-i,b-k-i]$ which proves (i) and (ii). 

Suppose now that one of the edges $e_{p+2q+1},\ldots,e_{p+2k}$ have $S$-interior length less or equal to $k+1$. Let $u$ and $v$ denote its vertices such that $|\llbracket u,v\llbracket|=k+1$. Then definition of $S$-interior length implies that $\llbracket u,v\rrbracket$ is a cyclic interval of $V$. Since $|V|=2k+1$, $\llbracket a,b\rrbracket$ and $\llbracket u,v\rrbracket$ can not be disjoint. Thus $\llbracket a,v\rrbracket$ or $\llbracket u,b\rrbracket$ is a cyclic interval of $V$ bigger that $\llbracket a,b\rrbracket$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Observe that this lemma has two consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item in any $k$-star $S$ with a $k$-boundary edge, the number of $k$-boundary edges equals the number of $S$-interior ears plus $1$;
\item for any $1\le i\le k-q$, the edges $e_{p+2q+2i-1}$ and $e_{p+2q+2i}$ can be matched: we say that there are \emph{$S$-neighbours}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{corollary}\label{earsenumeration}
The number of $k$-ears of a $k$-triangulation $T$ equals the number of internal $k$-stars plus $2k$.
In particular, $T$ contains at least $2k$ $k$-ears.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
For any $0\le i\le 2k+1$, let $\mu_i$ denote the number of edges of $T$ with exactly $i$ $k$-boundary edges. Let $\nu$ denote the number of $k$-ears of $T$. Then
$$\sum_{i=0}^{2k+1} \mu_i=n-2k \quad \mathrm{and}\quad \sum_{i=1}^{2k+1} i\mu_i=n.$$
Since any $k$-ear is an interior ear of exactly one $k$-star, the point (1) above ensures moreover that
$$\sum_{i=1}^{2k+1} (i-1)\mu_i=\nu.$$
Thus, we obtain $\nu=n-(n-2k)+\mu_0=2k+\mu_0$.
\end{proof}


We are now interested in a characterization of the $k$-triangulations that have exactly $2k$ $k$-ears, or equivalently that have no internal $k$-star. We need the following definitions.

We say that a $k$-triangulation is \emph{$k$-colorable} if it is possible to color its $k$-relevant edges with $k$ colors such that there is no monochromatic crossing.

A \emph{$k$-accordion} of $E_n$ is a set $Z$ of $k$-relevant edges of $E_n$ of form
$$Z=\bigcup_{i=0}^{\tilde{\ell}-1} \{[a_i,x]\;|\;x\in\llbracket b_{i+1},b_i\rrbracket\} \cup \bigcup_{i=1}^{\ell} \{[b_i,x]\;|\;x\in\llbracket a_{i-1},a_i\rrbracket\},$$
where $0\le \ell\le\lfloor n/2\rfloor-k-1\}$ and $\tilde{\ell}\in\{\ell,\ell+1\}$ and $a_0,\ldots,a_\ell,b_{\tilde{\ell}},b_{\tilde{\ell}-1},\ldots,b_0$ are vertices of $V_n$ in cyclic order with $a_0=b_0+k$ and $b_{\tilde{\ell}}=a_\ell+k$ (see fig. \ref{accordion}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{accordion.eps}}
\caption{\small{Examples of $3$-accordions of $E_{12}$.}}\label{accordion}
\end{figure}

Observe that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item there is no $2$-crossing in a $k$-accordion, so that there is no $(k+1)$-crossing in the union of $k$ $k$-accordions;
\item a $k$-accordion contains $n-2k-1$ $k$-relevant edges, so that the disjoint union of $k$ $k$-accordions contains $k(n-2k-1)$ $k$-relevant edges.
\end{enumerate}
According to corollary \ref{starsenumeration}, this proves that the disjoint union of $k$ $k$-accordions of $E_n$ is the set of $k$-relevant edges of a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon.

We have already met some particular $k$-accordions in two occasions: when we have constructed the triangulation $T_{n,k}^{\min}$ and in proof of lemma \ref{diamin}. The two types of $k$-accordions in these examples (in the first one with $\ell=1$ and in the other with $\ell=\lfloor n/2\rfloor-k-1$) are somehow the two extremal examples of $k$-accordions.

\begin{proposition}\label{colorable}
Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation, with $k>1$. The following assertions are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is $k$-colorable;
\item $T$ has no internal $k$-star;
\item $T$ contains exactly $2k$ $k$-ears;
\item the set of $k$-relevant edges of $T$ is the disjoint union of $k$ $k$-accordions.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be a $k$-star of a $k$-colorable $k$-triangulation. If all edges of $S$ are $k$-relevant, then, by pigeon-hole principle, there is a color that colors three edges of $S$. But when $k>1$, any three edges of a $k$-star form a crossing. Thus (i) implies (ii).

Corollary \ref{earsenumeration} ensures that (ii) and (iii) are equivalent.

To prove that (iii) implies (iv), we give an algorithm that compute $k$ disjoints $k$-accordions of a $k$-triangulation $T$ with $2k$ $k$-ears. Consider a $k$-ear $e_1$ and let $S_1$ be the $k$-star of $T$ such that $e_1$ is an $S_1$-exterior ear. Let $e_2$ be the $S_1$-neighbour of $e_1$. Let $S_2$ be the other $k$-star of $T$ containing $e_2$ and let $e_3$ be the $S_2$-neighbour of $e_2$. Let continue so untill we reach a $k$-ear. It is obvious that we get a $k$-accordion of $E_n$. To get another $k$-accordion, we do the same with a $k$-ear which is neither $e_1$ nor $e_{n-2k-1}$. 

To prove the correctness of this algorithm, we only have to prove that the $k$-accordions we construct are disjoint. Suppose for example that two of them $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{n-2k-1}\}$ and $\{f_1,\ldots,f_{n-2k-1}\}$ intersect. Let $i,j$ be such that $e_i=f_j$. Let $S$ be a $k$-star containing $e_i$. Then by construction, either $e_{i+1}$ or $e_{i-1}$ (resp. either $f_{j+1}$ or $f_{j-1}$) is the $S$-neighbour of $e_i$. Thus, either $e_{i+1}=f_{j+1}$, or $e_{i+1}=f_{j-1}$. By propagation, we get that $\{e_1,\ldots,e_{n-2k-1}\}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_{n-2k-1}\}$

Finally, (iv) implies (i) since we can color each $k$-accordion with one color.
\end{proof}

In the previous proposition, the assertion (i) does not implies (ii) when $k=1$ (since any triangulation is colorable). Let define the assertion
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i')] there exists a $k$-coloring of the $k$-relevant edges of $T$ such that in any $k$-star of $T$ contains three edges of the same color.
\end{itemize}
Then (i') is always equivalent to (ii), (iii) and (iv), and it is equivalent to (i) if and only if $k>1$.


Observe that the above proof of (iii)$\Rightarrow$(iv) gives the only possible partition of the $k$-relevant edges of a $k$-colorable $k$-triangulaiton $T$ into $k$ disjoint $k$-zigzags. Indeed, if $Z_1,\ldots,Z_k$ is such a partition, then for any $k$-star $S$ of $T$, any pair of $S$-neighbours has to be in the same $k$-accordion. 
It is easy to see that this provides also the unique possible $k$-coloration of $T$ (up to permutation of colors).


Finally, note that since a $k$-accordion of $E_n$ contains exactly two edges of length $p$ for any $k+1\le p\le \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$, and exactly one of length $\frac{n}{2}$ when $n$ is even, he previous proposition implies that a $k$-colorable $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon contains exactly $kn+2k(p-k)$ edges of length at most $p$ for any $k+1\le p\le \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$. It is proved by a flip method in \cite{n-gdfcp-00} that any $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon contains at least this number of edges of length at most $p$. We will prove it by induction in the next section, as an application of flattening a $k$-star.

\medskip

For any integer $p$, let $\mathfrak{S}_p$ denote the symetric group on $p$ elements, and let $\mathfrak{C}_p$ denote the cyclic subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_p$ generated by the cycle $(12\ldots p)$. 

\begin{lemma}
The three following sets are in bijection:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the set of accordions on $p+2$ points containing the ear $[-1,1]$;
\item the set of functions $t:\{1,\ldots,p\}\to\{0,1\}$ with $t(1)=1$ and $t(p)=0$;
\item the set of permutations $\tau$ of $\mathfrak{S}_p$ that fixe $1$ and such that for any $1\le i\le p$, either $\{1,2,\ldots,\tau(i)\}$ or $\{\tau(i),\tau(i)+1,\ldots,p\}$ is included in $\{\tau(1),\tau(2),\ldots,\tau(i)\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $Z$ be an accordion on $p+2$ points containing the edge $e_1=[-1,1]$. Let $e_2,\ldots,e_{p-1}$ denote the edges of $Z$ such that for any $2\le i\le p-1$, $\{e_{i-1},e_i\}$ forms an angle of $Z$. For  any $2\le i\le p-1$, let $x_i,y_i,z_i$ be vertices such that $e_{i-1}=[x_i,y_i]$ and $e_i=[y_i,z_i]$. Define $t:\{1,\ldots,p\}\to\{0,1\}$ by $t(1)=1$, $t(p)=p$ and for any $2\le i\le p-1$, $t(i)=0$ if $x_i\cl y_i\cl z_i$ and $1$ otherwise.

Let $t$ be a function from $\{1,\ldots,p\}$ to $\{0,1\}$ with $t(1)=1$ and $t(p)=0$. We define $\tau$ by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn1}\tau(i)=(1-t(i))(p+1-i)+\sum_{j=1}^{i} t(j).\end{equation}
It is easy to check that $\tau$ is a permutation of $\mathfrak{S}_p$, that $\tau(1)=1$ and that for any $1\le i\le p$, if $t(i)=1$ (resp. if $t(i)=0$) then $\{1,2,\ldots,\tau(i)\}\subset\{\tau(1),\tau(2),\ldots,\tau(i)\}$ (resp. $\{\tau(i),\ldots,p\}\subset\{\tau(1),\tau(2),\ldots,\tau(i)\}$).

Finally, if $\tau$ is a such permutation, then define $x_i$ and $y_i$, for any $2\le i\le p-1$, as follows:
$$x_i=|\{x\in\{1,\ldots, i\}\;|\; \{1,2,\ldots,\tau(i)\}\subset\{\tau(1),\tau(2),\ldots,\tau(i)\}\}|$$
$$ y_i=-|\{x\in\{1,\ldots, i\}\;|\; \{\tau(i),\ldots,p\}\subset\{\tau(1),\tau(2),\ldots,\tau(i)\}\}|-1.$$
Then $\{[-1,1]\}\cup\{[x_i,y_i]\;|\; 2\le i\le p-1\}$ is an accordion containing $[-1,1]$.

The three possible compositions of these three functions all equal identity. It is easy to compute the explicit inverses of this three functions.
\end{proof}

Let $\mathfrak{Z}_p$ be the set of permutations $\tau$ of $\mathfrak{S}_p$ such that there exists $\sigma$ in $\mathfrak{C}_p$ such that $\sigma\tau$ satisfies property (iii).
Let $\gamma$ be the permutation of $\mathfrak{S}_p$ defined by $\gamma(i)=p+1-i$ for every $1\le i\le p$.

\begin{lemma}
$\mathfrak{Z}_p$ is invariant by $\tau\mapsto \tau\gamma$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\tau\in\mathfrak{Z}_p$. Let $\sigma\in\mathfrak{C}_p$ and $t:\{1,\ldots,p\}\to\{0,1\}$ be such that equation (\ref{eqn1}) holds.
Let $\ell=\sigma\tau(p)$. Let $\tilde{\sigma}=(1\ldots p)^{1-\ell}\sigma$ and $\tilde{t}=1-t\gamma$.
The geometric interpretation of $\mathfrak{Z}_p$ let us guess that equation (\ref{eqn1}) holds for $\tilde{\sigma}\tau\gamma$ and $\tilde{t}$. It is just a computation to check it.
\end{proof}

Let $T$ be a $k$-colorable $k$-triangulation.
Since all $k$-stars of $T$ appear on the boundary, we can define a cyclic order on the set of $k$-stars of $T$ according to their order of appearance on the boundary.
Let $S_1,\ldots,S_{n-2k}$ denote the $k$-stars of $T$ in cyclic order.

Now, let $e$ be a $k$-ear of $T$, and let $Z$ be the $k$-accordion (of the unique partition of the $k$-relevant edges of $T$) containing $e$.
Let $e_1,\ldots, e_{n-2k-1}$ denote the edges of $Z$ such that $e_1=e$ and for every $1\le i\le n-2k-2$, $\{e_i,e_i+1\}$ is an angle of $Z$ (the algorithm we present in proof of proposition \ref{colorable} enumerates the edges of $Z$ in this order).
For any $2\le i\le n-2k-1$, let $\pi_e(i)$ be the integer of $\{1,\ldots,n-2k\}$ such that $\{e_{i-1},e_i\}$ is an angle of the $k$-star $S_{\pi_e(i)}$.
Let $\pi_e(1)$ (resp. $\pi_e(n-2k)$) be such that $e_1$ (resp. $e_{n-2k-1}$) is an interior $k$-ear of $S_{\pi_e(1)}$ (resp. $S_{\pi_e(n-2k)}$).
This defines a permutation $\pi_e\in \mathfrak{Z}_{n-2k}$.


Let $e_1,\ldots,e_{2k}$ denote the $k$-ears of $T$ in circle order.

\begin{lemma}
The permutations associated to two opposite $k$-ears $e_i$ and $e_{i+k}$ satisfy $\pi_{e_{i+k}}=\pi_{e_i}\gamma$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is obvious that the permutations associated to the two $k$-ears $e$ and $f$ of a $k$-accordion are related by $\pi_e=\pi_f\gamma$. Thus we only have to prove that the $k$-ears of any $k$-accordion are opposite $k$-ears. And it will be sufficient to prove that if $Z$ and $Z'$ are two disjoint $k$-zigzags, then their $k$-ears are alternated in cyclic order.

Let $a \cl b\cl c \cl d$ be four vertices in cyclic order, and suppose that $Z$ and $Z'$ are two disjoint $k$-accordions containing respectively $\{[a,a+k+1],[b,b+k+1]\}$ and $\{[c,c+k+1],[d,d+k+1]\}$. For any $x\in\llbracket c+k+1,d\rrbracket$, define $I_x=\{y\in V_n\;|\; [x,y]\in Z\}$ and $J_x=\{y\in V_n\;|\; [x,y]\in Z'\}$. The subsets $I_x$ and $J_x$ are disjoint cyclic intervals. Moreover, for any $x\in\llbracket c+k+1,d-1\rrbracket$, we have $\max I_{x+1}+1=\min I_x$ and $\max J_{x+1}+1= J_x$. This implies that if $d\cl I_x\cl J_x$, then $d\cl I_{x+1}\cl J_{x+1}$. This is not possible since $d\cl I_{c+k+1}\cl J_{c+k+1}$ and $d\cl J_d\cl I_d$.
\end{proof}

Let $\Pi$ denote the set
$$\{(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k,\pi_1\gamma,\ldots,\pi_k\gamma)\;|\;\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k\in \mathfrak{Z}_{n-2k}\}.$$
Let $\bar{\Pi}$ be the quotient set of $\Pi$ under the action of $\mathfrak{C}_{n-2k-1}\times \mathfrak{C}_{2k}$ defined by
 $$(g,h)\cdot(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_{2k})=(g\pi_{h(1)},\ldots,g\pi_{h(2k)}),$$
and let $\lambda:\Pi\to\bar{\Pi}$ denote the canonic projection. According to the previous lemma, we define an application from the set $\Gamma$ of $k$-colorable $k$-triangulations to $\bar{\Pi}$ by
$$\chi(T)=\lambda(\pi_{e_1},\ldots,\pi_{e_{2k}}).$$
This function is invariant under the action on $\Gamma$ of the dihedral group $D_n$ of transformations of the $n$-gon. Thus it descends to a function $\bar{\chi}$ from $\bar{\Gamma}=\Gamma/D_n$ to $\bar{\Pi}$. 

\begin{lemma}
The function $\bar{\chi}:\bar{\Gamma}\to\bar{\Pi}$ is injective.
\end{lemma}

\section{Flattening a $k$-star, inflating a $k$-crossing}\label{sectionflatinflat}

The goal of this section is to describe in terms of $k$-stars an operation that connects $k$-triangulations of $n$ and of $n+1$ vertices. This operation, already present in \cite{j-gt-03}, in \cite{n-gdfcp-00}, and when $k=2$ in \cite{e-btdp-06}, is useful for recursive arguments and it was a step in all previous proof of the flipability of a $k$-relevant edge.


\medskip
Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $(n+1)$-gon, and $e=[s_0,s_0+k]$ be a $k$-boundary edge of $T$.
Let $s_0,s_1=s_0+1,\ldots,s_k=s_0+k,s_{k+1},\ldots,s_{2k}$ be the vertices of the unique $k$-star of $T$ containing $e$, in the circle order.

We call \emph{flattening} of $e$ in $T$ the set of edges $\underline{T}_e$ whose underlying set of points is the set $V_{n+1}\smallsetminus\{s_0\}$ and which is contructed from $T$ as follows (see fig. \ref{flatinfl}):
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item for any edge of $T$ whose vertices are not in $\{s_0,\ldots,s_k\}$ just copy the edge;
\item forget all the edges $[s_0,s_i]$, for $1\le i\le k$;
\item replace any edge of form $[s_i,t]$ with $0\le i\le k$, and $s+k+1\cle t \cle s_{k+i}$ (resp. $s_{k+i+1}\cle t\cle s-1$) by the edge $[s_i,t]$ (resp. $[s_{i+1},t]$).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{flatinfl.eps}}
\caption{\small{Flattening a $3$-boundary edge - inflating a $3$-crossing.}}\label{flatinfl}
\end{figure}

\medskip
We want to prove that $\underline{T}_e$ is a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon. Observe first that
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f$ is a $k$-relevant edge of $\underline{T}_e$, then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item either $f$ is of form $[s_i,s_{k+i}]$, for some $1\le i\le k$, and it arise from two edges $f'=[s_{i-1},s_{k+i}]$ and $f''=[s_i,s_{k+i}]$ of the initial triangulation $T$;
\item or $f$ is not of the previous form, and it arise from a unique $k$-relevant edge $f'$ of $T$.
\end{enumerate}

\item If $f$ and $g$ are two $k$-relevant edges of $\underline{T}_e$ arising from $f'$ and $g'$ respectively, then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $f$ and $g$ do not cross, then $f'$ and $g'$ do not cross; 
\item if $f$ and $g$ do cross, then $f'$ and $g'$ do cross, except if there exists $i$ in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$, and $u,v$ two vertices such that $s+k\cl u\cle s_{i+k}\cl s_{i+k+1}\cle v\cl s$ and $f=[r_i,u]$, $g=[r_{i+1},v]$, $f'=[s_i,u]$ and $g'=[s_i,v]$. Such a configuration is said to be a \emph{hidden configuration}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

It is easy to derive from this that $|\underline{T}_e|=|T|-2k=k(2n-2k-1)$ and that any subset of $E_n$ that properly contains $\underline{T}_e$ contains a $(k+1)$-crossing. However, observe that it is not sufficient to prove that $\underline{T}_e$ is a $k$-triangulation. Thus we have to prove that $\underline{T}_e$ is $(k+1)$-crossing-free. Note that it will provides a third proof (which this time is recursive) of the number of edges of a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon.

\begin{lemma}
The set $\underline{T}_e$ is $(k+1)$-crossing-free.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $F$ be a $(k+1)$-crossing of $\underline{T}_e$. We denote $f_1=[x_1,y_1],\ldots,f_{k+1}=[x_{k+1},y_{k+1}]$ the edges of $F$ ordered such that $x_1\cl x_2\cl\ldots\cl x_{k+1}\cl y_1\cl y_2\cl \ldots\cl y_{k+1}$. Let $f'_1=[x'_1,y'_1],\ldots,f'_{k+1}=[x'_{k+1},y'_{k+1}]$ denote $k$ edges of $T$ that give the edges $f_1,\ldots,f_{k+1}$ respectively.

It is clear that if there exists no $1\le i\le k+1$ such that $(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})$ form a hidden configuration, then the edges $f'_1,\ldots,f'_{k+1}$ form a $(k+1)$-crossing of $T$, which is impossible. Thus we can suppose that the number of hidden configurations in the set $\{(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})\;|\; 1\le i\le k+1\}$ is at least $1$. We will find a new $(k+1)$-crossing $G$ of $\underline{T}_e$ arising from a set $G'$ of edges of $T$ such that the number of hidden configurations in the set $\{(g_i,g_{i+1},g'_i,g'_{i+1})\;|\; 1\le i\le k+1\}$ is strictly less than in $\{(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})\;|\; 1\le i\le k+1\}$.

Let $i$ in $\{1,\ldots,k+1\}$ be such that $(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})$ is a hidden configuration. We can suppose that $x_i=s_i$ and $x_{i+1}=s_{i+1}$ (if this is not the case, we renumber the edges of $F$ such that this be true). Thus we know that $y_i\cle s_{i+k}\cl s_{i+k+1}\cle y_{i+1}$. Let $p$ denote the first integer before $i$ such that $x_p \ne s_p$ or $s_{p+k}\cl y_p$, and $q$ denote the first integer after $i+1$ such that $x_q \ne s_q$ or $y_q\cl s_{q+k}$.

Let $G$ be the set of $k+1$ edges of $\underline{T}_e$ deduced from $F$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item for all $p<i<q$, let $g_i$ be $[s_i,s_{i+k}]$,
\item for all $q\le i\le p$, let $g_i$ be $f_i$.
\end{itemize}
Let $G'$ be the set of $k+1$ edges of $T$ constructed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item for all $p<i<q$, let $g'_i$ be $[s_i,s_{i+k}]$,
\item for all $q\le i\le p$, let $g'_i$ be $f'_i$.
\end{itemize}
		
It is quite clear that $G$ is a $(k+1)$-crossing of $\underline{T}_e$ arising from $G'$. We just have to verify that the number of hidden configurations in the set $\{(g_i,g_{i+1},g'_i,g'_{i+1})\;|\; 1\le i\le k+1\}$ is less than in $\{(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})\;|\; 1\le i\le k+1\}$. But
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the number of hidden configurations in $\{(g_i,g_{i+1},g'_i,g'_{i+1})\;|\; q\le i<p\}$ is exactly the same as in $\{(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})\;|\; q\le i<p\}$,
\item there is no hidden configuration in $\{(g_i,g_{i+1},g'_i,g'_{i+1})\;|\; p<i<q-1\}$, whereas there is one hidden configuration in $\{(f_i,f_{i+1},f'_i,f'_{i+1})\;|\; p<i<q-1\}$,
\item the edges $(g_p,g_{p+1},g'_p,g'_{p+1})$ (resp. $(g_{q-1},g_q,g'_{q-1},g'_q)$) do not form a hidden configuration.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\medskip
We now define the inverse transformation.

Let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon and $E=(s_1,\ldots,s_{2k})$ be a $2k$-tuple of $V_{n}$ in cyclic order such that $s_k=s_1+k-1$ and $[s_i,s_{i+k}]$ is an edge of $T$ for all $1\le i\le k$.
Let $s_0$ be a new vertex on the circle between $s_1-1$ and $s_1$.
We call \emph{inflating} of $E$ in $T$ the set of edges $\overline{T}^E$ whose underlying set of points is the set $V_n\cup\{s_0\}$ and which is contructed from $T$ as follows (see fig. \ref{flatinfl}):
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item for any edge of $T$ whose vertices are not in $\{s_1,\ldots,s_k\}$ just copy the edge;
\item add all the edges $[s_0,s_i]$, for $1\le i\le k$;
\item replace any edge of form $[s_i,t]$ with $1\le i\le k$, and $s_k+1\cle t \cle s_{k+i}$ (resp. $s_{k+i}\cle t\cle s_1-1$) by the edge $[s_i,t]$ (resp. $[s_{i-1},t]$).
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Observe that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any $k$-relevant edge $f$ of $\overline{T}^E$ arise from a unique edge $f'$ of $T$.

\item  If $f$ and $g$ are two $k$-relevant edges of $\overline{T}^E$ and $f'$ and $g'$ are the two edges of $T$ that correspond to $f$ and $g$ respectively, then if $f$ and $g$ do cross, then $f'$ and $g'$ do cross.
\end{enumerate}

The point (ii) ensures that $\overline{T}^E$ is $(k+1)$-crossing-free. Moreover, it is easy to see that $|\overline{T}^E|=|T|+2k=k(2(n+1)-2k-1)$. Thus, by corollary \ref{starsenumeration}, $\overline{T}^E$ is a $k$-triangulation of the $(n+1)$-gon.

\medskip
We can now use these inverse tranformations to prove results on $k$-triangulations by induction. 

\begin{corollary}
Let $N(n,k)$ denote the number of $k$-triangulations of an $n$-gon. The quotient $N(n+1,k)/N(n,k)$ equals the average number of $k$-crossings on the first $k$ points among all $k$-triangulations of the $n$-gon.
\end{corollary}

For example,
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item For $k=1$, we get that $N(n+1,1)/N(n,1)$ equals the average degree of vertex 1 in triangulations of the $n$-gon. Since the average degree of all triangulations of the $n$-gon is the same and equal to $(4n-6)/n$ we recover the well-known recursion for Catalan numbers:
$$C_{n-1}=\frac{4n-6}{n}C_{n-2}.$$

\item For $n=2k+1$ we have that $N(2k+1,k)=1$ (the unique $k$-triangulation is the complete graph)
and the number of $k$-crossings using the first $k$ vertices in this $k$-triangulation is $k+1$ (any choice of $k$ of the last $k+1$ vertices gives one $k$-crossing). In particular, we recover the fact that $N(2k+2,k)=k+1$.

\item Unfortunately, for $n>2k+1$ it is not true that the number of $k$-crossings using $k$ consecutive vertices is independent of the $k$-triangulation. Otherwise we would have that  $N(n+1,k)\cdot n /N(n,k)$ is an integer, equal to that number (as happens in the case of triangulations).
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
The following lemma is another example of utilisation of recursive argument. 

\begin{lemma}
Any $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon contains at least $kn+2k(p-k)$ edges of length at most $p$, for any $k+1\le p\le \frac{n-1}{2}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, it is obviously true when $n=2p+1$ since any edges is of length at most $p$ and the number of edges is $k(2n-2k-1)=kn+2k(p-k)$.

Suppose now that it is true for any $k$-triangulation of the $n$-gon and let $T$ be a $k$-triangulation of the $(n+1)$-gon. Let $e=[u,u+k]$ be a $k$-boundary edge of $T$. Let $E$ be the $k$-crossing of $\underline{T}_e$ that arise from the edges of the $k$-star of $T$ containing $e$.

Let $f$ be a $k$-relevant edge of $\underline{T}_e\setminus\{E\}$ arising from an edge $f'$ of $T$. It is obvious that if $f$ has length $\ell$, then $f'$ has length either $\ell$ or $\ell+1$, and the later is possible only if $f=[v,v+\ell+1]$ with $v\cle u\cl u+k\cle v+\ell+1$.

Let $F$ denote the set of edges of length $p$ of $\underline{T}_e\setminus E$ arising from an edge of length $p+1$ of $T$. Let $G$ be the set of edges  of $E$ of length at least $p$. 
Since any two edges of $F\cup G$ are crossing, we have $|F|+|G|=|F\cup G|\le k$. 

Finally, observe that any edge of $E\setminus G$ arise from two edges of $T$ of length at most $p$ and that any $k$-relevant edge of length at most $p$ of $\underline{T}_e\smallsetminus (E\cup F)$ arise from an edge of $T$ of length at most $p$. Thus we obtain by induction that the number of $k$-relevant edges of length at most $p$ in $T$ is at least
$$2k(p-k)-|F|+|E\setminus G|\ge 2k(p-k),$$
which implies the result.
\end{proof}


To close this section, observe that it is possible to define the flattening of a set of $k$-boundary edges. Indeed, let $e$ and $f$ be two distinct $k$-boundary edges of a $k$-triangulation $T$. Let $e'$ (resp. $f'$) denote the edge of $\underline{T}_f$ (resp. $\underline{T}_e$) arising from $e$ (resp. $f$). Then $e'$ (resp. $f'$) is a $k$-boundary edge of $\underline{T}_f$ (resp. $\underline{T}_e$) and
$$\underline{\underline{T}_f}_{e'}=\underline{\underline{T}_e}_{f'}.$$

Similarly, it is possible to define the inflating of a set of disjoint $k$-crossings of a $k$-triangulation.
